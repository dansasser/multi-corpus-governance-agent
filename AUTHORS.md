# About the Author

## Daniel T. Sasser II

Daniel T. Sasser II is a Cognitive Architect and the creator of the SIM-ONE Framework. With over two decades of experience in AI systems design and ethical AI governance, his work focuses on protocol-driven intelligence and the development of safe, efficient AGI.

### Core Philosophy & Vision

My work on the SIM-ONE Framework is driven by a core conviction: that the current race toward Artificial General Intelligence, dominated by a "bigger is better" philosophy of brute-force scaling, is unsustainable, unpredictable, and architecturally unsound. True intelligence, whether human or artificial, is not a product of size, but of structure.

I believe that a better path forward is not only necessary but possible—one built on a foundation of order, clarity, and architectural integrity. The principles and protocols outlined in this project are the result of first-principles thinking aimed at creating a new standard for governed, trustworthy, and ultimately comprehensible AI. This framework is my contribution to that effort—an open invitation to build a future for AI that we can all trust.
