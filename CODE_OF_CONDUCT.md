# **Multi-Corpus Governance Agent – Code of Conduct**

> This Code of Conduct governs interactions within the Multi-Corpus Governance Agent project, ensuring our principles of governance, clarity, and accountability extend to every contributor.

## **1. Our Pledge**

We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in the Multi-Corpus Governance Agent project and community a harassment-free and productive experience for everyone. Contributions are judged based on their **intellectual merit, technical alignment, and adherence to the governance model**, not on personal identity or background.

We recognize that rigorous debate and critical analysis are essential for progress, and we pledge to ensure these discussions remain respectful, constructive, and in service of the project’s principles.

## **2. The Governance Protocols of Interaction**

This project exists to demonstrate the power of **multi-corpus retrieval governed by layered agents**. All interactions within the community must reflect the same philosophy: structured, clear, and auditable.

### **Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive and rigorous environment:**

* **Clarity and Precision:** Communicating with reasoned arguments and actionable feedback grounded in the project’s documentation and goals.
* **Intellectual Honesty:** Acknowledging sources, citing corpora accurately, and accepting valid criticism gracefully.
* **Respectful Disagreement:** Engaging with differing viewpoints with the aim of strengthening outcomes, not “winning” arguments.
* **Governance Alignment:** Keeping discussions centered on the agent pipeline, governance rules, and metadata integrity.
* **Empathy and Professionalism:** Being considerate of the perspectives of others, even in debate.

### **Examples of unacceptable behavior:**

* Trolling, insults, or derogatory remarks.
* Public or private harassment of any kind.
* Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission.
* Sexualized language, imagery, or advances.
* **Willful Misrepresentation:** Intentionally distorting governance rules, spreading unverified claims as fact, or derailing technical discussions without evidence.
* Any conduct reasonably considered unprofessional or harmful to the project’s mission.

## **3. Our Responsibilities (Enforcement)**

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior. They may remove, edit, or reject contributions not aligned with this Code of Conduct. This reflects the principle that **the health and governance integrity of the project take priority**.

Delegated maintainers must uphold fairness, transparency, and respect for governance rules in all enforcement.

## **4. Scope**

This Code of Conduct applies in all official project spaces, including the GitHub repository (issues, PRs, discussions), and any direct communications relating to the project.

## **5. Enforcement & Consequences**

Reports of violations may be submitted to the project maintainer at `contact@gorombo.com`. All reports will be reviewed promptly, fairly, and with respect for the reporter’s privacy.

Possible consequences include:

1. **Correction:** A clarification of why the behavior violated the code.
2. **Warning:** A formal warning for a first or minor offense.
3. **Temporary or Permanent Ban:** For serious or repeated violations, access may be restricted.

All enforcement is carried out with the goal of **protecting the community and safeguarding governance integrity**.

## **6. Attribution**

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html), version 2.1, and tailored to reflect the governance philosophy of the Multi-Corpus Governance Agent.
