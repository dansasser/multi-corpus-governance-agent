# **Sim-One Framework - Code of Conduct**

> This Code of Conduct governs interactions within the Sim-One ecosystem, ensuring our principles of clarity, trust, and architectural integrity extend to every contributor.

## **1. Our Pledge**

We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in the Sim-One Framework project and its community a harassment-free experience for everyone. We are committed to a community where all individuals are treated with respect and dignity, and contributions are judged based on their intellectual merit and alignment with the project's principles, not on personal identity or background.

We believe that intense intellectual debate is essential for progress, and we pledge to ensure that even the most critical disagreements are conducted respectfully and constructively.

## **2. The Civic Protocols of Interaction**

The Sim-One Framework is an intellectual project built on a foundation of order, clarity, and architectural integrity. We expect all community members to adhere to these same principles in their interactions. All contributions are judged on their technical merit and adherence to framework principles—not on the contributor’s background or affiliations.

### **Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive and rigorous environment:**

* **Clarity and Precision:** Communicating with well-reasoned arguments and specific, actionable feedback that is grounded in the project's documentation and goals.
* **Intellectual Honesty:** Acknowledging sources and inspiration, gracefully accepting valid criticism, and arguing in good faith to find the best solutions.
* **Respectful Disagreement:** Welcoming and engaging with differing viewpoints. The goal of a debate is not to "win," but to collectively arrive at a more robust and well-defined outcome for the framework.
* **Focus on the Architecture:** Keeping discussions centered on the project, its principles, and its technical implementation.
* **Empathy and Professionalism:** Being kind and considerate of other community members and their perspectives, even when in disagreement.

### **Examples of unacceptable behavior:**

* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment of any kind.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
* **Willful Misinformation:** Intentionally spreading unsubstantiated claims, derailing conversations with logically unsound arguments, or promoting concepts that are antithetical to the project's core principles without a well-reasoned basis.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## **3. Our Responsibilities (Enforcement)**

The project maintainer is responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. This responsibility reflects the "Law of Structural Priority"—the integrity and health of the community and its mission must be prioritized. The project maintainer has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. In the event of delegated enforcement, project maintainers are expected to uphold the same principles of fairness, transparency, and architectural priority outlined in this code.

## **4. Scope**

This Code of Conduct applies within all official project spaces, including the GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions), and to any direct communications related to the project (e.g., via the official contact email addresses).

## **5. Enforcement & Consequences**

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainer at `contact@gorombo.com`. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

The project maintainer is obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

For violations of this code, the maintainer may take any action they deem appropriate, including but not limited to:

1.  **Correction:** A private or public communication to clarify the nature of the violation and explain why the behavior was inappropriate.
2.  **Warning:** A formal warning for a first or minor offense.
3.  **Temporary or Permanent Ban:** For a serious offense or for repeated violations, a temporary or permanent ban from the project spaces may be issued.

All enforcement actions will be carried out with the goal of protecting the community and the intellectual integrity of the project.

## **6. Attribution**

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html), version 2.1, tailored to reflect the core philosophical principles of the Sim-One Framework.
