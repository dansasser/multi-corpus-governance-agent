"""Protocol-driven architecture contracts for MCGA.

This package centralizes the authoritative schemas and constants derived
from root-level documentation (governance.md, routing-matrix.md,
context-assembly.md, and docs/security/protocols/governance-protocol.md).
Other modules must import from here instead of hardcoding policy.
