# Comprehensive Alignment Analysis: Documentation, Implementation, and MVLM Architecture

## Executive Summary

After reviewing all documentation, implementation plans, and the current codebase in light of the corrected MVLM understanding (governance-first, text generation separate), I can confirm that **everything aligns perfectly**. The architecture is consistent, Phase 1 is complete, and we're ready for Phase 2.

## Documentation Alignment Analysis

### **1. Implementation Plan ✅ ALIGNED**

**Key Points from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:**
- **PydanticAI as PRIMARY orchestration framework** (lines 13, 16, 216, 218)
- **Governance rules enforced through PydanticAI runtime**
- **Tool-based corpus access through PydanticAI tools**
- **Runtime governance validation that cannot be bypassed**
- **Agent role-based permissions enforced by framework**

**Alignment with MVLM Architecture:**
✅ **Perfect alignment** - PydanticAI handles ALL reasoning and governance
✅ **MVLM as text generation only** - fits perfectly with tool-based approach
✅ **Governance-first design** - exactly what the implementation plan specifies

### **2. Governance Documentation ✅ ALIGNED**

**Key Points from governance.md:**
- **Clear agent roles**: Ideator → Drafter → Critic → Revisor → Summarizer
- **API call limits**: Ideator (1-2), Drafter (1), Critic (≤2), Revisor (MVLM preferred), Summarizer (MVLM only)
- **Tool-based corpus access**: Each agent has specific corpus permissions
- **Governance enforcement**: Rules enforced at runtime, not in models

**Alignment with MVLM Architecture:**
✅ **Perfect separation** - Governance layer (agents) makes all decisions
✅ **MVLM as firebreak** - Revisor/Summarizer use MVLM for text generation only
✅ **API limits enforced by governance** - not by the text generation models
✅ **Tool-based approach** - governance decides which tools to use when

### **3. Routing Matrix ✅ ALIGNED**

**Key Points from routing-matrix.md:**
- **Classification → Multi-Corpus Retrieval → Context Assembly → Agent Chain**
- **Failure patterns**: Minor (local tweak), Major (revise call), Critical (stop)
- **No loops or undefined states** - linear pipeline with governance checkpoints
- **Transparent decision-making** - all routing decisions documented

**Alignment with MVLM Architecture:**
✅ **Governance controls flow** - routing decisions made by governance layer
✅ **Text generation on demand** - MVLM called only when governance decides
✅ **Clear separation** - routing logic separate from text generation
✅ **Failure handling** - governance layer handles all failure patterns

## Current Codebase Analysis

### **Existing Implementation Status:**

#### ✅ **Foundation Infrastructure (Phase 1 Complete)**
- **Scripts**: All operational scripts implemented and working
- **CLI**: Full command-line interface with model management
- **Configuration**: Comprehensive environment and package configuration
- **Smoke Tests**: Complete system validation framework

#### ✅ **Governance Framework (Partially Implemented)**
- **PydanticAI Base**: `agent_base.py` with proper types and interfaces
- **Call Tracking**: `call_tracker.py` with Redis and memory backends
- **API Limits**: `api_limits.py` for governance enforcement
- **Agent Structure**: Basic agent framework in place

#### ✅ **Multi-Corpus Infrastructure (Implemented)**
- **Database Models**: Personal, Social, Published corpus models
- **Search Tools**: Corpus search tools with governance integration
- **Context Assembly**: Context pack and snippet structures
- **Ingest Pipeline**: Data loading and processing tools

#### ⚠️ **Missing Components (Phase 2 Focus)**
- **Complete PydanticAI Agents**: Full agent implementations using PydanticAI
- **MVLM Integration**: Text generation interface for both models
- **Security Architecture**: Zero Trust implementation
- **Complete Pipeline**: End-to-end agent orchestration

## Architecture Alignment Verification

### **Governance-First Principle ✅ CONFIRMED**

**From Implementation Plan:**
> "PydanticAI agent framework as core orchestration system"
> "Runtime governance validation that cannot be bypassed"

**From Current Code:**
```python
# src/mcg_agent/pydantic_ai/agent_base.py
class GovernanceContext(BaseModel):
    task_id: str
    user_prompt: str
    classification: Literal["chat", "writing", "voice", "retrieval-only"]
    input_sources: List[Dict[str, Any]] = []
```

**Alignment:** ✅ **Perfect** - Governance context drives all decisions

### **Text Generation Separation ✅ CONFIRMED**

**From Governance Documentation:**
> "Revisor (MVLM preferred, 1 API fallback)"
> "Summarizer (MVLM only, API fallback optional)"

**From Current Code:**
```python
# src/mcg_agent/agents/ideator.py
async def run_ideator_local(user_prompt: str, task_id: str) -> ContextPack:
    """Production local-mode Ideator runner.
    
    Invokes registered PydanticAI tools (with governance enforcement) under
    the Ideator role to assemble a ContextPack deterministically without
    requiring an LLM call.
    """
```

**Alignment:** ✅ **Perfect** - Local governance logic, external text generation

### **Multi-Corpus Integration ✅ CONFIRMED**

**From Routing Matrix:**
> "Multi-corpus retrieval (Personal, Social, Published)"
> "Context pack with attribution preserved"

**From Current Code:**
```python
# src/mcg_agent/agents/ideator.py
p = await personal_search(ctx, user_prompt, PersonalSearchFilters(), 5)
s = await social_search(ctx, user_prompt, SocialSearchFilters(), 5)
pub = await published_search(ctx, user_prompt, PublishedSearchFilters(), 5)
```

**Alignment:** ✅ **Perfect** - Multi-corpus search with governance context

## Phase Alignment Analysis

- ✅ Operational scripts for development and deployment
- ✅ CLI tool for system management
- ✅ Package configuration for installation
- ✅ Environment configuration for all settings
