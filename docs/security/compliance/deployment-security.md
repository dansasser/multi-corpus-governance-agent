## 🎯 Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive security checklist that MUST be completed before any production deployment of the Multi-Corpus Governance Agent system. No deployment may proceed without verification that ALL security requirements have been met and validated.

### Deployment Security Objectives
1. **Ensure Complete Security Posture**: All security controls operational before go-live
2. **Validate Governance Enforcement**: Agent governance rules tested and working
3. **Confirm Audit Readiness**: Logging and monitoring fully functional
4. **Verify Compliance**: All regulatory requirements satisfied
5. **Enable Incident Response**: Security team ready for production incidents
