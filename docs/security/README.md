## 🛡️ Security Framework Overview

The Multi-Corpus Governance Agent implements a **defense-in-depth security strategy** with the following key principles:

### 1. **Governance-First Security**
- All security controls enforced through the governance layer
- PydanticAI tools validate permissions before any corpus access
- Runtime enforcement of agent limitations and access controls

### 2. **Multi-Layer Protection**
- **Input Layer**: Strict validation and sanitization
- **Agent Layer**: Role-based permissions and API limits
- **Data Layer**: Corpus isolation and encryption
- **Infrastructure Layer**: TLS, authentication, and monitoring

### 3. **Security by Design**
- Security requirements integrated into development lifecycle
- Threat modeling for all new features
- Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Comprehensive audit logging and attribution tracking

## 🚨 Critical Security Requirements

### For Development Team
1. **Mandatory**: Read `protocols/governance-protocol.md` before implementing agents
2. **Required**: Follow `protocols/code-review-security.md` for all code reviews
3. **Essential**: Validate all changes against `architecture/security-architecture.md`

### For Operations Team  
1. **Critical**: Use `compliance/deployment-security.md` for all deployments
2. **Required**: Monitor according to `incident-response/security-monitoring.md`
3. **Essential**: Follow `incident-response/incident-response-playbook.md` for incidents

### For Compliance Team
