# Scaffolding Beyond AGENTS.md: How Governed Cognition Shapes AI Repos

## Introduction: The Trouble With Vibe Coding

Most repos don’t start with much structure. Folks dive straight into code, hoping the rest will sort itself out. That’s fine for humans who can read between the lines. It’s a mess for coding agents.

Without a map, agents spin. They loop on vague tasks, miss context, and burn tokens for nothing. That ain’t efficient, and it sure isn’t repeatable.

AGENTS.md showed up as the fix. A single file that gave agents something steady to grab hold of. In our first model from **[The SIM-ONE Framework](https://github.com/dansasser/SIM-ONE)**, we learned the same lesson: intelligence lives in governance, not in scattered notes or brute force.

This new repo builds on that philosophy. It takes AGENTS.md further by laying out routing rules, governance layers, and context assembly. The result is a scaffold that keeps noise down and lets agents get to work faster.

## Call to Action

Want to see it in action? The repo is ready here: [Multi-Corpus Governance Agent Repo Placeholder].

Star it, fork it, and add your own connectors. Having it saved means you’ve always got a scaffold on hand for new agent-first projects.

Be sure to check out [The SIM-ONE Framework Repo Placeholder] too. That repo isn’t just philosophy — it’s almost fully built, with about 95% of the functional code in place and a complete proof of concept you can explore today.

These repos ain’t meant to sit idle. They’re built to be reused, tested, and improved. If you’ve got ideas, open an issue or push a pull request.

The more folks star and build on governed scaffolds, the quicker agent-first development moves from trend to standard.
