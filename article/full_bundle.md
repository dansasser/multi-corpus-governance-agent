## First Draft Article (Sections)

### Introduction

Most repos don’t start with much structure. Folks dive straight into code, hoping the rest will sort itself out. That’s fine for humans who can read between the lines. It’s a mess for coding agents.

Without a map, agents spin. They loop on vague tasks, miss context, and burn tokens for nothing. That ain’t efficient, and it sure isn’t repeatable.

AGENTS.md showed up as the fix. A single file that gave agents something steady to grab hold of. In our first model from **The SIM-ONE Framework**, we learned the same lesson: intelligence lives in governance, not in scattered notes or brute force.

This new repo builds on that philosophy. It takes AGENTS.md further by laying out routing rules, governance layers, and context assembly. The result is a scaffold that keeps noise down and lets agents get to work faster.

### The Trouble With Vibe Coding

Most repos start loose. Folks dive into code and pray the rest falls into place. Humans can squint and guess intent. Coding agents can’t.

Without a map, agents spin. They loop on vague tasks, miss context, and burn tokens for nothing. That ain’t efficient, and it sure isn’t repeatable.

In our first model from **The SIM-ONE Framework**, we proved that reliable output comes from governance, not brute force. This project carries that lesson into scaffolding so agents have rules, not guesses.

---

### The Rise of AGENTS.md

AGENTS.md didn’t land by accident. It came out of a real gap that kept slowing folks down. Developers could spin up a repo with a README, but coding agents were left blind.

That single file answered those problems. AGENTS.md laid out the basics in a way agents could parse. Setup instructions. Dependencies. Testing conventions. Even notes on how to handle output.

Adoption was quick. Tens of thousands of projects on GitHub picked it up. Industry outlets started writing about it. The idea went from niche to standard in months, because it worked. Builders cut wasted cycles. Agents got context they could trust.

In our first model from **The SIM-ONE Framework**, we found the same truth. Intelligence comes from governance, not guesswork. AGENTS.md was a step toward that, but it’s still just a single file. The next move is bigger: full scaffolds that extend those same principles across the whole repo.

---

### The Limits of a Single File

AGENTS.md gets agents to the front door. It does not tell them what to do once ten doors open at once. Startup is covered. Ongoing decisions are not.

Here is what falls through the cracks when you stop at AGENTS.md: routing logic, governance policy, context assembly, observability, failure handling, data contracts, and evaluation harnesses.

A single page also hides change management. Agents need versioned policies, not tribal memory. That requires scoped files with clear owners.

Concrete example. A user asks, “Summarize my notes and turn that into a LinkedIn post.” With only AGENTS.md, an agent might hit the wrong source, overfill context, and post informal copy. With the scaffold, routing hits Personal first, then Published for voice, governance weights professional tone, assembly trims to budget with attribution, and evals keep it from drifting.

---

### Governance as the Real Intelligence Layer

This repo makes governance the boss. The rules live in `governance.md`, `routing-matrix.md`, and `context-assembly.md`.

Governance runs a tight loop. It classifies intent. It routes to the right connector. It ranks results, then assembles clean context with attribution and budgets.

Here is the payoff. A prompt asks for a LinkedIn post based on private notes. Governance classifies the task, routes to Personal then Published, ranks the hits, and assembles a concise, attributed context that fits the window.

Governance is the brain of this scaffold. Next, the connectors act like the hands. They reach into each corpus and bring back the right pieces under these same rules.

---

### Connectors and Modular Memory

Connectors are where this repo shows its modular design. Each connector is a file with its own schema and rules. We use three here: `personal-search.md`, `social-search.md`, and `published-search.md`.

Each connector draws from a separate corpus. Personal covers reflections and chat history. Social covers posts meant for public feeds. Published covers polished writing like blogs or articles. Governance can call one or all, depending on the prompt.

This split matters. It keeps memory auditable. Agents ain’t guessing which pile of data to dig in. Developers can swap connectors in or out without breaking the whole repo.

That’s modular memory in practice. Governance is the brain. Connectors are the hands. They reach into the right corpus, bring back the goods, and pass them along clean under the same set of rules.

---

### A Repo Built as a Living Example

This project ain’t theory. It’s a scaffold you can open up, read through, and put to work. Every file has a job and nothing is left for guesswork.

```text
multi-corpus-governance-agent/
├── README.md
├── agents.md
├── routing-matrix.md
├── governance.md
├── context-assembly.md
├── personal-search.md
├── social-search.md
├── published-search.md
└── docs/
    ├── diagrams/
    │   ├── system-flow.txt
    │   ├── system-flow.dot
    │   └── system-flow.png [Diagram PNG Placeholder]
    └── project-status.md
```

The core docs set the rules. The connector files lay out schemas and retrieval filters. The diagrams show the flow in ASCII and DOT. Scripts like `init.sh` and `render-diagrams.sh` make it easy to spin up or refresh the repo.

This repo proves scaffolding can be structured before a single line of code. That’s what keeps the noise down and gives coding agents the map they need.

---

### Why Builders Should Care

This repo gives builders a backbone they can see. `governance.md` explains how to rank and trim. `routing-matrix.md` sets the path for each type of prompt. Connector files hold schemas so agents ain’t left to guess.

It makes work faster and steadier. Picture an agent told to turn private notes into a LinkedIn post. Without a scaffold it might grab the wrong data, overfill context, and spit casual copy. With this repo, routing checks Personal then Published, governance enforces tone, and context assembly keeps it tight.

It also grows easy. A team can add a connector for research or logs without breaking what’s there. Scripts like `init.sh` spin it up fast, and `render-diagrams.sh` keeps the visuals current. Folks can fork it and wire in their own data while trusting the same rules.

That’s why this matters. Less wasted time. Faster onboarding. And repos that stay auditable, extendable, and portable.

---

### Toward a Standard of Governed Repos

The path is clear. We started with messy repos that left agents guessing. AGENTS.md fixed the first mile, but this repo shows how to take it further.

Governance is the difference. Rules for routing, ranking, and assembly live in plain files. Connectors split data into clean pieces so agents ain’t crossing wires. The whole design proves intelligence sits in structure, not chance.

This repo is more than a demo. It’s a model builders can fork, extend, and trust. Diagrams, scripts, and docs turn it into a working pattern, not just an idea on paper.

That’s where things are headed. Governed repos will be the new standard for agent-first coding. In our first model from **The SIM-ONE Framework**, we showed that cognition is governed. This project proves the same principle in a scaffold anyone can use.

---

### Call to Action

Want to see it in action? The repo is ready here: \[Multi-Corpus Governance Agent Repo Placeholder].

Star it, fork it, and add your own connectors. Having it saved means you’ve always got a scaffold on hand for new agent-first projects.

Be sure to check out \[The SIM-ONE Framework Repo Placeholder] too. That repo isn’t just philosophy — it’s almost fully built, with about 95% of the functional code in place and a complete proof of concept you can explore today.

These repos ain’t meant to sit idle. They’re built to be reused, tested, and improved. If you’ve got ideas, open an issue or push a pull request.

The more folks star and build on governed scaffolds, the quicker agent-first development moves from trend to standard.
