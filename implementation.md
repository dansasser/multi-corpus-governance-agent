Implementation Plan: Multi-Corpus Governance Agent

1. Finalize social and blog databases. Create tables for posts, comments, articles, and sources in their respective ingest modules. Extend ensure_tables functions with relationships and indexes. Provide import routines for JSON or CSV files to persist records.

2. Implement search connectors for the new corpora. Add ORM query helpers for social posts and published articles. Define filter and result models. Register SecureAgentTool search tools so agents can query personal, social, and published corpora through a unified interface.

3. Add drafter, critic, revisor, and summarizer agents. Create modules for each role that follow the Ideator pattern. Each agent needs dependency and context classes and a public run_<role>_local function that emits AgentOutput and metadata bundles.

4. Wire the new agents into the pipeline. Update routing/pipeline.py to invoke drafter, critic, revisor, and summarizer sequentially after the ideator. Replace the execute_agent_stage placeholder with logic that selects the correct agent and captures token statistics and change logs.

5. Expand governance checks and auditing. Implement validation methods in security/governance_enforcer.py to enforce API limits, corpus permissions, and output policies. Enhance governance/api_limits.py and security/audit_trail.py to track per-agent limits and emit immutable audit events. Violations should raise domain-specific GovernanceViolationError subclasses.

6. Expose the governed pipeline through a CLI or HTTP API. Add an entry point that instantiates GovernedAgentPipeline and accepts user prompts, returning responses. Document usage in the README.

7. Integrate the trained language model when it is ready. Extend mvlm/provider.py so pipeline stages can call the trained model for drafting, critique, revision, and summarization. Allow configuration to switch between deterministic behavior and model-based execution.

8. Finalize end-to-end tests and documentation. Write integration tests covering context retrieval, agent sequencing, governance enforcement, and interface behavior. Update README and supporting documents with ingestion instructions, pipeline configuration, and usage examples.
