Here’s a **SECURITY.md** written in the same style and tone as the one you use for **The SIM-ONE Framework**, but adapted for this new repo: **Multi-Corpus Governance Agent**.

# 🔒 Security Policy – Multi-Corpus Governance Agent

## 📖 Overview

Thank you for helping keep the **Multi-Corpus Governance Agent** and its users safe.
This policy explains how to report vulnerabilities, what is in scope, and how coordinated disclosure is managed.

---

## 📌 Supported Versions

We provide security fixes for:

* The latest release on the `main` branch
* The most recent minor release if an LTS tag is active in this repository

Older releases may receive fixes on a case-by-case basis if the impact is critical and the patch is low risk.

---

## 📨 Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email **[security@gorombo.com](mailto:security@gorombo.com)** with the subject line:
**\[SECURITY] Vulnerability Report**

Include:

* A clear description of the issue and potential impact
* Minimal proof of concept or reproduction steps
* Affected version or commit hash and environment details
* Logs, stack traces, or screenshots if available
* Your contact information for coordinated follow-up

⚠️ Do **not** open public GitHub issues for suspected vulnerabilities.

If the issue involves a third-party dependency, report it to us and to the upstream project where possible.

---

## ⚡ Our Response Process

* **Acknowledgment** within 3 business days
* **Triage & Severity rating** (using CVSS 3.1 guidance) within 7 business days
* **Fix plan** with estimated timeline after triage
* **Advisory publication** when a fix or mitigation is available

We will keep you informed during triage and remediation and invite you to validate fixes where appropriate.

---

## 🤝 Coordinated Disclosure

* Default embargo period: **90 days** from acknowledgment
* May be shortened or extended depending on exploitability, user impact, or availability of mitigations
* Reporters will be credited in release notes and advisories unless anonymity is requested

---

## 🎯 Scope

**In scope:**

* Vulnerabilities in Multi-Corpus Governance Agent source code and official packages
* Security issues in default configuration or documented deployment paths
* Supply chain risks affecting how the agent is built or distributed

**Out of scope:**

* Social engineering, phishing, or physical attacks
* Denial of service through excessive traffic without a specific software flaw
* Self-XSS requiring a user to paste code into their console
* Vulnerabilities in unrelated third-party services not exploitable through this project
* Issues on demo or non-production environments not affecting the software itself

If unsure about scope, please send the report — we will triage it.

---

## 🛡 Safe Harbor

We will not pursue or support legal action against researchers who:

* Act in good faith and comply with this policy
* Avoid privacy violations and destruction of data
* Do not disrupt production systems
* Do not attempt to access data that is not yours
* Give us reasonable time to remediate before public disclosure

---

## 📢 Security Updates and Advisories

Security fixes will be announced through:

* GitHub Releases
* Repository CHANGELOG
* GitHub Security Advisories (GHSA) when applicable

Critical fixes will include upgrade guidance and mitigations.

---

## 🔗 Dependencies and Supply Chain

We monitor vulnerabilities in direct dependencies and build tooling.
If you discover a vulnerability in our build or release process, please report it via the same contact channel.

---

## 📬 Contact

**[security@gorombo.com](mailto:security@gorombo.com)**

For commercial users with support contracts, please use your support channel in addition to the above email.

Do you want me to also put together a **LICENSE.md recommendation** (e.g., MIT vs AGPL) tailored for this repo, given it’s more of a personal assistant agent than a framework?
